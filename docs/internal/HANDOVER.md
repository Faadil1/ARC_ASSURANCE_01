# ARC_ASSURANCE_01 — Handover

Updated: 2026-09-27

## 1. Current baseline

Repository: `Faadil1/ARC_ASSURANCE_01`

The repository has been bootstrapped on `main`. The product name remains open; `ARC_ASSURANCE_01` is an internal identifier.

Current concept is locked:

> continuous assurance for autonomous paid work

Core loop:

```
PRECOMMIT TEST
→ REAL WORK
→ HIDDEN CANARY
→ DETERMINISTIC VERIFY
→ PAY / BLOCK / CIRCUIT BREAKER
```

The original ProofTender procurement-platform direction is closed.

## 2. Why the concept changed

A five-model council (Claude, Grok, Perplexity, Gemini, Kimi) plus current ecosystem checking converged on a narrower problem:

- generic agent wallets/payment rails already exist;
- procurement/bidding/escrow/reputation are not sufficient differentiation;
- policy gates alone are crowded;
- evidence-gated payment alone is not enough;
- the strongest surviving mechanism is a test committed before execution, hidden from the provider, repeated during production, with deterministic financial consequences.

## 3. MVP boundary

MVP vertical: structured document extraction.

The system must not rely on subjective evaluation.

Mainnet critical path:

```
Arc mainnet
+ real USDC
+ assurance contract
+ real provider HTTP service
+ deterministic scorer
+ provider signature
+ verifier CLI
```

Agent Wallets, Nanopayments, x402, ERC-8004 and ERC-8183 are not required for promotion.

## 4. Current gate

**G0 — PRD_READY**

This workstream establishes:

- `product/PRD.md`
- `docs/internal/CANONICAL-STATE.yaml`
- `docs/internal/HANDOVER.md`
- `docs/internal/WORKSPLIT.md`
- contribution rules

No consequential product build should be treated as promoted until G0 is merged/reviewed.

## 5. Immediate blocker

Faadil has already sent Opeyemi (`opeblow`) a collaborator invitation with the intended write access.

Current status:

- collaborator invitation: **INVITE_PENDING**
- next action: **Opeyemi accepts the existing GitHub invitation**
- after acceptance, verify that `opeblow` can push a branch/open a PR and request him on PR #1.

No new invitation is required unless the existing one expires or is declined.

## 6. Next gate

**G1 — T0_MAINNET_CUSTODY**

Owner: Opeyemi.

Before UI work, prove with a minimal contract on Arc mainnet:

```
real USDC
→ contract custody
→ configured payout
→ remaining-funds refund
```

Capture real transaction references and balances.

Do not claim the broader product is mainnet-proven merely because T0 succeeds. T0 proves only the custody/payment primitive.

## 7. Parallel work after G0

Opeyemi:
- `feat/t0-mainnet-custody`

Faadil:
- `feat/canonical-scorer`

These workstreams may proceed in parallel because they touch separate surfaces.

Do not parallelize conflicting ABI/state-machine implementations.

## 8. Hero proof target

The final demo must show:

1. real Arc mainnet budget funded;
2. hidden canary committed before execution;
3. provider output cryptographically locked;
4. PASS → real payout;
5. controlled degraded provider behavior;
6. FAIL → real no-pay;
7. configured repeated failure → breaker;
8. remaining funds protected/refunded;
9. verifier independently reconstructs the proof.

Controlled fault injection must be labeled as such.

## 9. Truth boundaries

Never say:

- “blockchain proved the result was objectively good”;
- “the agent made the right decision”;
- “Arc mainnet proof” when showing testnet/local/stub behavior;
- “third-party provider failure” when using our own controlled fault injection.

Safe claim:

> The acceptance test was committed before the provider result, the provider committed to the output before reveal, deterministic verification produced this state, and the configured USDC consequence followed.

## 10. Continuous recording rule

After any meaningful:

- accepted product decision;
- merged implementation milestone;
- real mainnet execution;
- material failure;
- invariant change;
- gate transition;

update both:

- `docs/internal/CANONICAL-STATE.yaml`
- `docs/internal/HANDOVER.md`

before declaring that workstream complete.
